BUGS TO FIX
===========

* Changing cursor position (either by keypress or mouse click) should reparse back
from position to find nearest PHP function. Should popup hint for function.
Should also work for cases like: outer( inner(

* Class browser: handle the choice of parsing only current file
in the configuration

NEW FUNCTIONALITY/FEATURES
==========================

* Memory of Incremental Search strings

* Metric reporting (Function length, LOC)

* Turck-mmcache integration

* Debugger Support

* Project/Live site editing

* Bookmarks: Ctrl+F2 makes a bookmark at a line, and with F2 you cycle
through all bookmarks in line number order.
If you insert a line before a bookbmark, the bookmark line is shifted 1
up, so that the bookmark stays on the code line you've originally selected

* Tabs: with context menu

* Change the text on the taskbar button to be more meaningful

* class view: when there are multiple files with the same class names, it
would be nice if the file name is directly appended in the class view,
not only when clicking on it (or the diff to the other file names ;))

This can be implemented using a treeview with classes under the files
and under an All Files item

* Print current PHP file, using Anjuta code.

* Implement Ctrl+Space toolbar popup

> And it would be standard-conform (to ms visual studio and some others)
> to have Ctrl+Shift+Space = show hint to current function [helpful if
> your'e changing the code and not writing new calls] and Ctrl+Space =
> Show function dropdown immediateley.

CODE CLEANUP AND MISC CHANGES
=============================


* Take out gtkscintilla wrapper
